Cats and Dogs Image Classification using SVM
This project implements a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to categorize images of cats and dogs from the Kaggle dataset. This robust machine learning model enhances image classification accuracy, providing valuable applications in diverse fields.

Introduction
Image classification is a fundamental task in computer vision. This project focuses on classifying images of cats and dogs using a Support Vector Machine (SVM). The Kaggle dataset provides a large collection of labeled images, making it an ideal choice for training and evaluating the model.

Features
Data preprocessing and augmentation
Feature extraction using Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)
SVM model training and evaluation
High accuracy in classifying images of cats and dogs

Usage
Data Preprocessing: Preprocess the images and extract features using HOG.
Model Training: Train the SVM model using the preprocessed data.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance on the test set.
